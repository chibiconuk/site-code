			<p>Chibi-Con is the first anime convention held at the University of Essex. It is hosted by the Anime and Manga Society. We have been to many conventions across the country and we enjoyed them so much we wanted to have a go at making our own. We want to include as many societies at our university as possible as well as local businesses. We will also be inviting performers to come and join us. There will be a variety of events and stalls throughout the day to keep you busy.</p>
			<p>We hope you will join us for what we hope to be the start of a new chapter here at the University of Essex.</p>
			<p>Chibi-Con will be held on Saturday 28th January 2017. Opening times are 10am – 6pm. Last entry 5:30pm.</p>

			<p>The best way to get to the University of Essex Colchester Campus would be to get to Colchester station (Not Colchester Town). From there you will have access to buses that can take you to the university. The 61 and 62 bus will take you to campus.</p>
			<p>When you arrive on campus there will be signs and staff to help guide you to Base and the Lecture Theatre Building (LTB) where the event will be taking place.</p>
